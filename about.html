    Who I Am
    <!--Background Information-->
    Hi, my name is Ian. I am 18 years old and a current student at Thaddeus Stevens College of Technology, enrolled in the Computer Software Engineering Technology (CSET) program.

    Throughout highschool, I was given the opportunity to explore introductory programming through Visual Basic courses as well as an introductory web development course, offered at my high school. These courses along with my own curiousity sparked an interest in the programming field and led me to deciding to purse a career in programming. 

    Today, I am studying hard in every aspect of programming I can possibly learn at this point in time and having the time of my life doing so.
